\begin{abstract}
An alarming amount of studies have successfully exposed the various vulnerabilities of automotive networks. This results in an ever growing number of potential attack surfaces being revealed, like Bluetooth, GPS, Infotainment, etc. One of these is the on-board diagnostics (OBD-II) interface. OBD-II was originally designed as an efficient way of retrieving information from the internal vehicle network. However, it has frequently been exposed as an easy way of gaining unauthorised access. This paper aims to illustrate the scope of this problem, by first providing some insight in how a typical vehicle network operates, before surveying the security related problems of these networks. The first part of this paper is concerned with the vulnerability of the OBD-II port as a potential attack vector, motivating the need for a lightweight security protocol. \\ \\
The second part of this research paper is dedicated to our attempt at securing the OBD-II interface. A role-based access control model is proposed, that curtails the wide open nature of the interface, requiring an authentication procedure to be performed before access is granted. Our solution is purely software-based, so no hardware modifications are required. Our design employs asymmetric key cryptography to identify legitimate users, and symmetric key cryptography to facilitate secure communications. Furthermore, a permission table is introduced to enforce a predefined security policy. We implement and evaluate our proposal in terms of security, speed and portability. Our proposal and it's subsequent evaluation, serve as a proof of concept of how extant OBD-II systems can be secured, as well as how automotive diagnostics systems could be designed in the future.
